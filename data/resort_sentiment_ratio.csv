1,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,5.0,"Highly recommended! Me and my family had a fantastic time at Perisher Ski Resort. The facilities were great, and the snow was perfect for all skill levels. I’d especially like to commend the exceptional service at the Perisher Valley Visitor Information Centre. Elise was incredibly helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable — she went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. Her assistance made a real difference to our trip. Thank you, Elise!",458,POSITIVE,0.9998736381530762
2,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,5.0,"Visited Perisher valley, Smiggin Holes.. Which is a ski resort before Perisher. It's best for beginners as it has a few tracks which are not steep and then more for intermediate and more challenging ones as well. Will be back here soon. Snow was great and they were allowing tobogganing on the far right on an empty hill with lots of snow.",339,POSITIVE,0.9917426705360411
3,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,3.0,"Perisher Valley is absolutely magical – the snowfall was incredible and the kids had an amazing time playing in the snow. It’s a winter wonderland and truly a beautiful spot for a snow holiday.
However, I would not recommend visiting during the peak school holiday season. The traffic was completely out of control. By 8:30 AM, the resort parking was full and thousands of cars were being turned back, with no prior updates or warnings. We saw the same chaos at Thredbo as well.
We ended up losing our bookings – and a lot of money – due to this poor management. There’s a serious lack of infrastructure and communication to handle peak crowds. It’s clear the area hasn’t been upgraded to support the number of visitors it receives during holidays.
Go for the snow and scenery – it’s worth it – but avoid the peak season unless you’re prepared for a logistical nightmare.",871,NEGATIVE,0.989859402179718
4,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,2.0,"We do the skiing once a year during the last 9 years, never experienced the full capacity (due to the parking). When we arrived at 12pm on Saturday, we got advised by the police that it was full. We heard the situation is based on one car out followed by one car in. I can see many cars were leaving Perisher Valley Resort, but no car was allowed to go in. I was so frustrated with the situation as I have already bought the lift tickets for the whole family. We went to the restaurant near the checkpoint for lunch and resting. At around 2pm, suddenly it was allowed to go in. We were lucky to be in the first group to drive in. When we arrived at the Perisher Valley Ski Resort, it was so easy to find parking, inside the rest area where people eat and rest, it was less busy as well. I struggle to appreciate the reasoning of denying the access for a few hours. Totally unnecessary. In the past the ski resort was much busier, never denying people for access. I tried to email Perisher Ski Resort to check if it was possible to transfer the lift pass from day time to evening time, unfortunately no response. On Sunday, we deliberately got there early just in case of denied access due to the full capacity. Luckily I didn't see the police checkpoint. When arrived at Perisher Ski Resort, it was very difficult to find parking. It took me over 35 minutes. Overall I did enjoy the beautiful moments on the snow, but not a good experience in terms of denied access on Saturday.",1478,NEGATIVE,0.9989678859710692
5,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,4.0,I think Perisher does a good job given the constraints nature deals it. But they do need to provide more parking. It would be great if they invested in more wind tolerant lifts and more toilets.,194,NEGATIVE,0.9978741407394408
6,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,5.0,"We had a fantastic family trip to the Perisher valley mountain! The kids loved tobogganing down gentle slopes and building snowmen. There were easy trails perfect for beginner skiers, and we even had a short ski lesson together. The snow play area was safe and well managed, with lots of space to run around. We enjoyed hot chocolate in the warm café while watching the snow fall. The views were stunning, and everything was well organised for families. It was a great place to make winter memories, and we can’t wait to come back next year for more snow fun! Of all, kids had a great time and are keen to do more skiing.",621,POSITIVE,0.9997963309288024
7,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,1.0,"My experience at Perisher was unfortunately the worst I’ve had at any ski resort.
I had pre booked my snow gear (board and boots) online, yet I still had to wait in the same queue as everyone else, with no dedicated line for online bookings and an insufficient number of staff at the pick up counters. This completely defeats the purpose of booking ahead and reflects poor service management.
Additionally, I’ve never been to a ski resort where the lifts have no leg rests. This felt unsafe for both children and adults, especially as the safety bars kept lifting unexpectedly. Having to carry the snowboard attached to my foot caused significant knee pain, which lasted for days.",680,NEGATIVE,0.9997977614402772
8,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,5.0,"Our family booked ski lessons at Perisher, and we had a 2-hour session with a lovely instructor named Ashley, who came all the way from Scotland. She was really nice and did a fantastic job managing even our 6-year-old boy, helping us all enjoy skiing in such a short time. It was a truly meaningful experience, and I’d like to express our gratitude to Ashley once again!",371,POSITIVE,0.9998620748519896

10,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,4.0,"It’s a lovely place for both beginners and seasoned skiers. There’s a dedicated child-friendly zone, making it perfect for families. The snow-covered slopes were well maintained, and there are plenty of snow play areas to enjoy beyond skiing. The resort is well-equipped with cozy cafés and restaurants nearby, so you can relax and warm up between runs. A fantastic alpine experience all around!",395,POSITIVE,0.999831199645996
11,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,3.0,"I came to perisher to ski for the first time, but I found it was quite overpriced for lift tickets and rentals. The lack of signs made it hard to find your way around, especially if you've never been there before. They had lots of options from first timers to very experienced skiers/boarders. The food places were way overpriced and pretty average tasting. Most restaurants didn't even accept cash. It was fun but not great value. Also, I don't recommend toboganning here as they don't have a conveyor belt to get back up the hill, so it was very tiring climbing back up.",572,NEGATIVE,0.9979339838027954
12,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,1.0,"As a single parent, I saved and sacrificed a lot to be able to afford the expensive lift tickets so my kids could spend one day at Perisher skiing with their friend for my son’s birthday present. However, we were told there was no parking, which apparently happens a lot and they know it happens but don’t say anything about it on the website or warn you when you purchase tickets. Due to a medical condition, taking a bus as an alternative was NOT possible. They were NOT allowed to enter even to drop off the kids to ski! So the lift passes could NOT be used! Perisher is IMPOSSIBLE to contact as they do NOT HAVE A WORKING PHONE NUMBER. Even Experion does not have a valid phone number. Their online chat was useless and unhelpful. They said they would send an email with information but never did. Perisher is a SCAM!!! It ruined my kids’ holiday, which they were looking forward to all year, and I saved and sacrificed so much to be able to provide them! This is a SCAM and a FRAUD!!!! NEVER GO TO PERISHER, NEVER BOOK LIFT PASSES WITH THEM!!!!!!!! YOU WILL WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND BE LEFT WITH ONLY TEARS AND DISAPPOINTMENT!",1136,NEGATIVE,0.9984487295150756
13,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,3.0,"We visited Perisher last week and found it overwhelmingly busy. Lift pass queues were frustratingly long, and once on the slopes, the heavy traffic made it difficult to enjoy the snow. It often felt crowded rather than relaxed, which took away from the overall experience.
Another surprise was the lack of facilities — there weren’t many places to sit down, put on boots, or get sorted before hitting the slopes. Even something as simple as more benches or undercover areas would go a long way.
For family members who aren’t skiing, it was hard to find a comfortable spot to sit, stay warm, and just enjoy the mountain atmosphere. A quiet area to read a book or take in the view would’ve made a real difference.
Perisher has a great location, but the crowding and lack of practical amenities made this visit less enjoyable than we’d hoped.",839,NEGATIVE,0.996188461780548
14,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,5.0,"A large interconnected Ski Resort with a variety of terrain difficulties and beautiful views.
During my most recent visit (15/7/25 to 18/7/25), conditions varied from frigid, windy and snowing to beautiful and sunny as seen in the attached photos. Snow levels were approximately 160cm at peak. Ski seasons are very variable in Australia due to climatic patterns and the effects of climate change.
The new Mount Perisher 6 Chair is very comfortable and significantly quicker than the chairs it replaces. A welcome upgrade.
Food on the mountain is expensive as you would expect from a Ski Resort but is generally okay with some particularly good restaurants available (See other reviews).
Crowds can be intense during the School Holidays and this period should be avoided if possible. Perisher staff are usually deployed to manage crowds. Avoid beginner slopes if possible as these will be more crowded.",901,POSITIVE,0.9995918869972228
15,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,3.0,"I would like to share a disappointing experience I had at Perisher Resort.
Yesterday, I purchased a morning lift ticket at around 11:00 AM from the ticket counter. The staff did not inform me that this ticket was only valid until 1:00 PM, and that it might be better to purchase an afternoon pass instead due to the time.
Later, I realized the limited validity of the morning ticket and returned to ask if I could change to an afternoon ticket. I was told this was not possible, and that I would have to pay an extra $34 for a full-day ticket.
After reading through the lift ticket terms and conditions on the official Perisher website (as shown in the attached image), I couldn’t find any policy that explicitly prohibits changing the time slot for a same-day ticket — especially when the ticket was purchased shortly before the morning session ended.
I believe this miscommunication cost me an extra $270 unnecessarily, and could have been avoided with a simple explanation or recommendation from the staff.
As someone who does not speak English fluently and was visiting Perisher for the first time alone, I feel that the staff should have made the situation clearer.
I hope Perisher Resort can improve the communication and ticketing process to help guests — especially international visitors — make more informed choices.
Thank you for your understanding.",1360,NEGATIVE,0.9996229410171508

Customer service is terrible.
Tried to talk to someone in management. They now only have AI chat bots to talk to. No phone number. And there offices have been closed down.
What’s life coming to when you can’t speak to a human and only AI is available.
Another gripe is that Perisher is short staffed. Cafes often have a 45 minute wait for a coffee.
Perisher took over all of the private run food on the mountain. Now close the places at a drop of a hat.
The mountain is not the same.
Also the maintenance of lifts, buildings, toilets doesn’t happen.
The place is falling apart. Afraid of a major incident occurring on a lift.",662,NEGATIVE,0.9995860457420348
25,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,1.0,"Disappointed experience. The kids’ ski lesson was poorly run — the instructor barely taught anything, and there was no feedback or follow-up. We were also forced to buy a lift ticket for the lesson, even though beginners don’t use the lift. It feels like unfair bundling.
Non-skiers in our group bought lift tickets too, but weren’t allowed to ride the lift without ski gear — this wasn’t mentioned on the website, so we wasted over $400.",438,NEGATIVE,0.9997889399528505

30,Perisher Ski Resort,1379.0,3.0,"Subject: Safety Concern at Perisher Ski Resort
Dear Perisher Ski Resort Team,
I’m writing this review in the hope that it prompts some changes to improve safety on the slopes. Currently, it appears that anyone — including those who have never skied before — can simply arrive at the resort, rent equipment from outside vendors, park, walk in, and head straight to the lifts without any skill check or guidance.
There seems to be no procedure or regulation in place to ensure that visitors have at least basic skiing or snowboarding skills before accessing the slopes. This lack of oversight increases the risk of injury — not only to inexperienced individuals but also to others on the mountain.
For example, a young lady had a loose snowboard hit her spine while she was sitting and listening to her instructor. The owner of the board had no idea how to ride it or how to place it face down so it doesn’t slide down the slope and hit someone.
I strongly suggest introducing a process to verify that all guests have at least basic ability before they’re allowed on certain slopes. Even a quick assessment or dedicated beginner check-in area could go a long way toward preventing accidents and making the resort safer for everyone.
Overall, I had a great time :).
Thank you for considering this feedback.",1303,NEGATIVE,0.9994884729385376

Even amidst a gentle mist, the pristine snow-covered landscapes and the crisp, invigorating mountain air weave an unforgettable tapestry of romance. From the shared thrills on the slopes to the cozy warmth by a crackling fire pit, and the breathtaking scenic chairlift rides offering intimate glimpses of the surrounding beauty, it's an absolutely incredible and deeply romantic alpine escape in Victoria.

36,Mt Buller,1649.0,4.5,"I recently spent a long weekend at Mt Buller and honestly, I didn’t want to leave. The whole experience felt like stepping into a snow globe – from the moment we arrived, everything was covered in soft powder and the village had this cozy alpine charm.

The ski runs were well maintained and there was a great mix for all levels – I’m more of an intermediate skier, but my partner is a beginner and we both found slopes we loved. The lift lines were manageable even during the weekend rush, and the staff were friendly and helpful (especially the folks at the chairlifts – kudos to them for keeping things moving in the cold!).

The village itself had everything we needed – warm coffee shops, surprisingly good pizza, and a few pubs for après ski. We stayed in one of the lodges close to Bourke Street and could basically ski in and out, which made a huge difference.

That said, Mt Buller isn’t without its flaws. The resort can get very crowded on weekends and during school holidays, which means longer lift queues and busier slopes, especially around the main runs. Accommodation and food are on the pricier side — pretty standard for Aussie snow spots, but still something to factor in. Parking and access can be a bit of a mission too; if you’re not staying overnight, getting up the mountain and catching the shuttle with all your gear isn’t exactly seamless. And depending on the season, snow coverage can be a bit unpredictable — best to check the forecast before booking.

Still, despite the few unavailabilities and bad let-downs, Mt Buller totally lived up to the hype. Whether you're a first-timer or a seasoned skier, it’s well worth the trip. Already planning our next visit.",1691,POSITIVE,0.9995977282524108

To ensure good snow, we chose mid-August, one of the busiest times. However, the snow conditions weren’t as great as we hoped, likely due to the weather. Crowded areas had a lot of slush, like the lift queue areas, though the staff worked hard to maintain them. The weekend crowds led to long lift lines, and at $220 a day, I found the lift tickets overpriced. I know weekday prices are better, but for full-time workers, there’s little choice.

It would be easy for the hotel to buy a portable cable to lend to visitors when the their Tesla charger is broken - but they can’t be bothered.

The maps was showing there a 16 minute delay to get inside (before the pay station) after all that wait there was a guy in vest one of the rangers telling every single individual car one at a time that if they have a reservation they can come in if they don't they can't, and then we where redirected to leave. We asked the ranger what was going on and they said at the top they where at full capacity. So we went and parked on the side of the road and luckily one guy said there is buses we can take to go to the top for free. So we were like nice there is a chance we can still go. The car was parked like 5mins away to where the ranger was and he was like the main big bus broke down and they can't bring people up. We went to the pay booth to see what's happening and the lady was like they're not accepting any more on the spot tickets they're only accepting pre- booked. There was a mini van taking people up and down but it was like a 2 hour wait, the mini van was fit for like 12 people. A waste of day! Anyone going make sure pre book and go early!!!

Moving on, TIRE CHAINS, I waiting for 1 hour getting tire chains at Noojee Bush Goods payed $30 for just the chains. When we went to the mount baw baw they sold chains for $40 (without fitting), $50 with fitting. It's best to just spend the extra $10 rather than wasting an hour.

Highly recommend pre booking resort entry, as it can save you few bucks. Entry to toboggan park can also be pre booked.

Toboggan sledding is favourable for first timers but if you want a challenge, snowboarding can be the next option.
The downside is, you have to carry your equipment everytime unless you decide to bring it back to the rental shop.
Also, staff in rental shops are moody as they can be impatient with customers and food is also expenaive and not in good quality. So if you have your own suits and equipment, also food, better to bring them but if it can be a hassle or only using it for once then better rent or borrow from friends or family who have snow gears and equipment.

183,Charlotte Pass Snow Resort,1759.0,4.2,"The worst and most expensive 4 hour holiday I've ever been on- if I could give 0 stars I would. My partner and I spent nearly $1000 (!) for lift passes and gear hire for 2 days of skiing, expecting an enjoyable skiing getaway. Instead, it turned into a horrifying ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon anyone.

Our morning started well, making the most of the remaining Spring snow in September. However, after lunch, things took a disastrous turn. While going up on the chairlift for a green run, I missed the exit ramp of the chairlift. I stayed seated thinking I would just be let off by the Operator - but no I ended up tripping a trip wire with my ski. This led to a sudden stopping of the chairlift where I was flung at great force into a platform (photo below). This broke 6 ribs on impact. I then fell over 2m to the ground getting whiplash in the process. I'm not sure why the chairlift was set up like that but my guess is because so much snow had melted by Spring this had created a several metre gap between the platform and ground.

What shocked me even more was the response, the Operator restarted the chairlift as I lay under it waiting for first aid. They then asked me to move ""as it was not safe"" to be under a moving chairlift (!!)- I had to crawl away as I was in so much pain and there had been no first aid assessment of my injuries so spinal injury couldn’t be ruled out at this stage. Management's response was equally shocking. They seemed indifferent and took weeks to reply to emails which was surprising given the extent of my injuries.

Exiting a chairlift shouldn't pose a life-threatening risk. If you value your safety I would not recommend going here. I feel ""lucky"" I only broke 6 ribs. I think if I'd landed any differently once being flung from the chairlift I could have been much more seriously injured or worse. Terrible holiday.",1864,NEGATIVE,0.9993693232536316

++ Very good resort for children (they can't get lost and it's not crowded)
++ Not a lot of people on the slopes
++ Great for beginners since the runs are short
- The lifts need upgrading (speed and comfort)
- The T-Bar and Poma lifts need more grooming during the day (gets lumpy and people fall off)
- Lift operators need to be trained (high speed poma operator hands over the bar the wrong side and you get catapulted while trying to correct his mistake), chairlift operator on top needs to be much more aware about people standing below exit and not moving out of their way. 1 operator went slaloming around the people going up on the T-Bar.",887,POSITIVE,0.9789370894432068

After a huge effort getting there - the oversnow was 50mins late so keeping children contained in the Perisher terminal after a 7 hour journey to get there was hard. That I can understand but what was really disappointing was the staff. There seemed to be zero customer service. There was one girl on the desk at guest services who was the most unhelpful & disinterested person I’ve ever encountered. She charged me for our ski/boots hire when I went to book lessons for the kids, she didn’t explain anything and getting any info was like trying to get blood out of a stone. She suggested that I go online to look at prices but I had no internet connection while I was in the guest services office. She ended up charging me for ski/boot hire which were already part of my prepaid package. I wasted an entire morning trying to sort that out and I’m still waiting for the $404 refund from over a week ago. Her disinterest really made a negative impact on my experience.
On the up side, it wasn’t too busy so no long lines, short and fun ski runs which was great. There was one staff member named Hunter working at the Poma who made getting in line a delight. He was so friendly and funny. It would have been great if all the staff had his attitude. I would have rated it 5 stars if so. And some of the staff at the Kosciuszko Chalet were pretty good, the guys working kids club was amazing. The food was pretty good. Although one night our group had a dinner booking for 7.30pm and we didn’t get to sit at our table until 9pm. That wasn’t great, the kids were wrecked by that time and none of us were even really hungry anymore.

Definitely the snobbiest of the Victorian ""Resorts"". It has obviously been developed to be self serving for the elite who are members of the private lodges there. Unless you are prepared to pay for a formal sit down meal at a restaurant in the village, the lack of public areas is shocking. Well we did find the official designated ""public area"" (and signed as such) - a couple of dirty couches in a corner outside the toilets. Every door we opened we were confronted with a “Please Wait to be Seated” sign. Found Hoots was OK if you’re happy to have a pizza and watch the beginners come down Wombats Ramble. The skiing was pretty good once you get up the top, and Cloud 9 is a decent place to have lunch or a snack (only $19 for a bowl of sweet potato chips) but no Picnics allowed (also signed in multiple languages on every pole).

We had an amazing time at Selwyn Ski Resort! It’s a fantastic spot for families — our kids had an absolute blast. The staff were incredibly friendly, and the ski lessons were well run. Big shoutout to Paige, who was wonderful with the kids! Paige looks after us last Sunday for a group of 10 kids.

Ski hire was much cheaper than at Thredbo or Perisher, which was a great bonus. While food prices were a bit higher, it’s understandable given the seasonal nature of the resort.

The resort closes at 4:30 PM, which actually worked out well for relaxing evenings. The drive up was stunning — snow-covered and very scenic. We also found more affordable accommodation options nearby in places like Tumut.

Overall, this was our best snow trip yet — we’ll definitely be back super soon!

Pls list a phone number to contact you, would be very handy for people planning it for the first time, few things on the website is confusing, not very clear. Thank you

242,Selwyn,799.0,3.9,"If your TIME is valuable, this isn’t the place for you, don’t be fooled by 5 star reviews in here. I  hoped bad reviews on this were just one bad weekend, it isn’t. This place wouldn’t care about your time, ski hire queue is the slowest queue on earth - we waited for over 3hrs on a not so long queue to get the skis, and it was already midday by the time we got them. And we missed our lessons and when we tried to communicate that, they showed us others who were also in same boat and the guy at counter was like I can’t do anything about it. He offered to book a lesson for $50 😆- which I can do myself too.

You’d think you are better off if you BYO skis or hire elsewhere- you are happily joining another queue to use the chair lift. If you are hungry, you are joining another queue, coffee? There’s another queue. They should change the name to Queues Snow Resort 😁

This place is greedy and will issue as many tickets passes as possible with no attention to capacity in terms of staff or facilities. Staff seem helpless, well under capacity snd unhappy.

The cafe area was almost always full all day, so  you can’t really find a place to sit. Toilets were ok.

She learned so much more than at her snow boarding lesson at Thredbo. They they really encouraged her and before the day was out, she was all over the mountain!

247,Selwyn,799.0,3.9,"Subject: Disappointing Experience at Selwyn Ski Resort – Request for Resolution

Dear Selwyn Ski Resort Management,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the experience my family and I had at your resort during our visit on the weekend of July 13, 2025. Arriving at 8.30am Unfortunately, the quality of service we encountered was far below expectations, especially considering the high cost of our visit.

1. Staffing and Operations:
Given the online booking system in place, it would seem that you would have had an accurate indication of the number of visitors for that weekend. However, it was clear upon arrival that your resort was significantly understaffed.

Your rental desk had five counters, yet only two or three were staffed, with minimal assistance provided to the large crowd. We had to wait for over 5.5 hours just to pick up our rental gear.

By the time we were finally on the slopes, it was 2:45 pm, leaving us with just 1 hour of skiing before the resort closed at 4pm. As we had paid for full-day lift tickets for 2 adults and 2 children, this experience was incredibly disappointing.

2. Lift Ticket Machines:
Out of four available machines, only one was functioning, causing lengthy delays and further frustration for all visitors trying to purchase tickets. This level of disorganization is unacceptable for a resort of your size.

3. Food and Beverage Service:
At the cafe, there were only two baristas managing both coffee orders and counter service. The wait times were excessive, with a 45-minute wait for a coffee and hot chocolate, which is simply unacceptable.

4. Facility Cleanliness:
The resort's toilets and other facilities were noticeably unclean, and I did not observe any efforts to maintain or sanitize them throughout the day. This is particularly concerning in a high-traffic environment like a ski resort.

5. Cashless Payment and Connectivity Issues:
While I understand the move to a cashless resort, the lack of proper internet reception is a major issue. Many visitors, including ourselves, were unable to complete transactions or access your website due to poor mobile network coverage, leading to further inconvenience.

In light of these numerous issues, we have clearly been misled by your advertising and charged for services that were not provided as promised. As a result, I will be lodging a formal complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for misleading advertising and inadequate service delivery.

Given the severe lack of service and the frustration we encountered, I kindly request a full refund for the lift tickets and rental fees pre paid for close to 4 weeks before our attendance.

I hope you will take the time to address these concerns and take immediate steps to improve the guest experience for future visitors. I look forward to your prompt response.",2869,NEGATIVE,0.9995111227035522
248,Selwyn,799.0,3.9,"As a first timer to see the snow, I was thoroughly impressed. A 4 and a half hr drive from Sydney. We were amazed to see the difference in weather from muggy in Sydney to a downpour of rain in Jindabyne. The drive to Selwyn has you doubting that snow even exists here in NSW. It's not until you are 1 hr out from the resort that the snow and ice appear. Absolutely breath taking views. The resort is nice. I wish the machines were working out of the 6, There only was 1 which worked. Which an employee had to stand there and hand feed cards through. Also, maybe cover the kiosk machines. I was retieving 10 cards yesterday and found it hard as the place where the kiosks are placed is right bang in the middle of an air tunnel, and it's freezing. There is no cash on premises it is strictly cashless. Staff and instructors were incredibly helpful/ patient and kind. We will definitely be back again.",899,POSITIVE,0.9991368651390076

We had pre-booked ski rentals and lift pass expecting a fun and well-organized snow day, but instead spent the entire day stuck in long, disorganized queues. There was absolutely no proper system, no crowd control, and no clear communication from the staff. Despite having a booking, we never received our rentals – just stood in line for hours with nothing to show for it.

The resort was clearly overwhelmed and unprepared for the number of visitors. Staff seemed lost, and no one took responsibility or provided solutions. What should have been a great day out turned into a frustrating, exhausting, and completely wasted experience.

This is unacceptable, and we absolutely deserve a refund for both the poor service and lost time. I strongly do not recommend Selwyn Snow Resort to anyone based on this experience. They need to seriously improve their operations and customer service.",965,NEGATIVE,0.9997416138648988

🏔️ Terrain & Facilities

Spanning 45 hectares, Selwyn provides a variety of gentle slopes ideal for novice and intermediate skiers. The resort features 8 lifts, including two chairlifts, two T-bars, a platter, a poma, and two magic carpets, ensuring accessible terrain for all skill levels. Notably, 88% of the terrain caters to beginners and intermediates, with the “Racecourse Run” offering a challenge for advanced skiers.  ￼ ￼

After the devastating 2019–2020 bushfires, Selwyn underwent a complete rebuild, reopening in June 2023. The revamped facilities include modern equipment hire, clean dining areas, and efficient lift operations, enhancing the overall guest experience.  ￼ ￼

⸻

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family-Friendly Atmosphere

Selwyn is renowned for its family-oriented environment. The resort’s layout allows parents to easily supervise children, and the tobogganing and tubing areas are particularly popular among younger visitors. The manageable size of the resort ensures a relaxed and enjoyable experience without the overwhelming crowds found at larger resorts.  ￼

⸻

💰 Affordability & Accessibility

Selwyn stands out as one of Australia’s most budget-friendly ski resorts. Adult day passes are priced at AUD 119, with youth and child passes at AUD 95 and AUD 35, respectively.  The resort’s proximity to Sydney (approximately a 5-hour drive) and Canberra (about 2.5 hours) makes it an accessible option for day trips or short getaways. ￼ ￼

While there is no on-mountain accommodation, nearby towns such as Adaminaby, Talbingo, and Cooma offer various lodging options to suit different budgets.  ￼

⸻

❄️ Snow Reliability & Conditions

Selwyn’s lower altitude can lead to variable snow conditions, especially early and late in the season. However, the resort has invested in extensive snowmaking capabilities, covering 35 hectares, to ensure consistent snow coverage. August typically offers the best natural snow conditions, with an average base depth of 26 inches.  ￼ ￼

🧳 Visitor Tips

•	Arrive Early: To secure parking and avoid crowds, especially during peak times, it’s best to arrive early.()
•	Check Snow Reports: Stay updated on snow conditions and lift operations via the resort’s official website before planning your trip.  ￼

For the 2 days we went there was only one lift open apart from the bunny hill and on the first day even this was shut for a few hours in the afternoon.
The toilets weren’t very clean and there wasn’t much seating outside.

257,Selwyn,799.0,3.9,"I recently visited Selwyn for my first time skiing. While I truly enjoyed the experience of learning to ski, that was in spite of how the resort was managed, not because of it.

Several safety concerns stood out—most notably, the presence of exposed metal fencing around the beginner tracks. Unfortunately, I injured my knee on one of these, which left me feeling that the environment was not as safe as it should be, especially for beginners.

Food options were limited and surprisingly expensive. What made this more frustrating was the lack of visible pricing—there were no price tags, so I only discovered the cost at the register, which felt a bit misleading.
The bathrooms were also disgusting and looked like they had never been cleaned. There was only one soap dispenser and they had replaced the soap with water!

I also found the general attitude of the staff disappointing. During my lesson, the instructor took an unnecessarily harsh tone with participants, singling out individuals for making mistakes and drawing attention to them in a way that felt humiliating rather than constructive. That said, I want to acknowledge that Sienna and Paige were both incredibly kind and helpful, and their friendliness was a real bright spot during the visit.
